### lazylines 

This project contains a minimal method-chained API to deal with `.jsonl` files. 
The API is inspired by [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and is designed to be lazy.
Everything is a generator until you call `.collect()`. 

The best way to explore is to check the docs on GitHub pages.
