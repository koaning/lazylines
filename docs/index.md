Lazylines is a small Python library that makes it easier to work with
lists of dictionaries as well as JSONL files. It was originally designed
to help handle some boilerplate for some of my custom [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy)
recipes.

Here's what the base usage might look like:


```python
from lazylines import read_jsonl 


```
